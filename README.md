# Network Routing Using Link State Algorithm

This project implements network routing using the Link State Algorithm. It allows users to input the number of routers, their names, and the distances between them, and then calculates the shortest path using Dijkstra's Algorithm.

## Features

- Input the number of routers and their names.
- Input the distances between routers.
- View Link State Tables for each router.
- Calculate and display the shortest path using Dijkstra's Algorithm.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Flask

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
2. Navigate to the project directory:
3. Install Flask:


## Usage

1. Run the Flask application:
2. Open a web browser and go to `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`.
3. Enter the number of routers, their names, and distances between them.
4. Submit the form to view Link State Tables and Dijkstra's Algorithm results.
